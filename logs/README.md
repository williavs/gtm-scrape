# Logging Directory

This directory contains log files generated by the application.

## Log Files

- `app.log`: Contains standard application logs (INFO level and above)
- `debug.log`: Contains detailed debug logs (DEBUG level and above)

## Log Levels

The application uses the following log levels:

- DEBUG: Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems
- INFO: Confirmation that things are working as expected
- WARNING: An indication that something unexpected happened, or may happen in the future
- ERROR: Due to a more serious problem, the software has not been able to perform a function
- CRITICAL: A serious error, indicating that the program itself may be unable to continue running

## LangSmith Tracing

If a LANGCHAIN_API_KEY is provided in the .env file, the application will automatically enable LangSmith tracing for the personality analysis workflow. This allows you to visualize and debug the workflow in the LangSmith UI.

To enable LangSmith tracing, add the following to your .env file:

```
LANGCHAIN_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key
```

## Viewing Logs

You can view the logs using any text editor or with command-line tools like:

```bash
# View the last 50 lines of the app log
tail -n 50 app.log

# Follow the debug log in real-time
tail -f debug.log
```
